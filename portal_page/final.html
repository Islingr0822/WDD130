            <h2>My Page</h2>
            <p>Allen got my page I "hired" him to create about half done. I wish I could have seen it finished. Wish there could have been more communication. That's how things go sometimes though I suppose. Glad I know how to use html so I can do it myself if needed. I made a lot of the images for the site plan, I went with magikarp themed so I needed lots of that. Luckily ChatGPT does a pretty mean magikarp.  </p>

            <h2>Tranquill Page</h2>
            <p> I think this went really well. I did a mixture of talking to my team in class and leaving notes for them in the project readme file. Github caused a few pain points with how a couple things had to be changed, but it all worked out. The page looks pretty great, sad I couldn't get Chloe's opinions since she hasn't been in class. The experience was good, both my lead devs did great and got their assignments done on time!</p>

            <h2>Bess Page</h2>
            <p>It was super easy! The lead dev set things up great and I just had to do a little bit of HTML set up and a couple changes to some css and it was all ready to go. Super easy to find my assignment, it was right in the readme file. Learned a little bit about Rubik's cubes along the way. Github worked fine for me on this one.</p>

            <h2>Juttner Page</h2>
            <p>Unfortunatly I never received a site plan or instructions for the page, and so was unable to do any work on it. Wish I could have.</p>
